git remote add upstream https://github.com/misbahsy/video-audio-mcp.git
```

### 2. 🏗️ Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If it exists
```

### 3. 🌿 Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a descriptive branch name
git checkout -b feature/add-opencv-face-detection
# or
git checkout -b fix/audio-conversion-bug
# or
git checkout -b docs/improve-installation-guide
```

### 4. 🛠️ Make Your Changes

#### Adding New Tools

When adding support for a new library, please:

1. **Add the dependency** to `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
2. **Create new MCP tools** following our existing patterns
3. **Include comprehensive error handling**
4. **Add detailed docstrings** with examples
5. **Write tests** for your new functionality

#### Example: Adding a New Tool

```python
@mcp.tool()
def detect_faces_opencv(video_path: str, output_path: str, confidence_threshold: float = 0.5) -> str:
    """Detects faces in a video using OpenCV and draws bounding boxes.
    
    Args:
        video_path: Path to the input video file.
        output_path: Path to save the video with face detection boxes.
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence for face detection (0.0-1.0).
    
    Returns:
        A status message indicating success or failure.
    """
    try:
        import cv2
        # Your implementation here
        return f"Face detection completed successfully. Output saved to {output_path}"
    except ImportError:
        return "Error: OpenCV not installed. Please install with: pip install opencv-python"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}"
```

### 5. 🧪 Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run existing tests
pytest tests/

# Run your specific tests
pytest tests/test_your_new_feature.py -v

# Test the MCP server manually
python server.py
```
